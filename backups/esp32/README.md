This directory would contain a backup of the original nspanel ESP32 firmware.  It's a dump of the full 4MB flash and can be used to restore the ESP32 part of the NSPanel back to the factory state.
Except of course it's littered with my wifi password in clear text, so I'm adding a git ignore to not upload it.  I imagine that it's not that hard to get a copy of the original clean FW.

Actually, I'm uploaded an encrypted copy just in case I need it.  If you're desperate for a copy let me know.

It was backed up twice and hashed to make sure it's correct.  The procedure to download the flash is docuemnted here: https://cyberblogspot.com/how-to-save-and-restore-esp8266-and-esp32-firmware/
Nice work that guy.
