Port my Raspi based smart thermostat to Nextion

My original smart thermostat was built on a Rasp Pi and a 3.5" touchscreen and used a custom UI library written in Python.  I was pretty happy with it, but now I'm going to try and port it over to Nextion and use the Sonoff NSPanel instead. 

The reason for this is that the NSPanel is a much nicer package with PSU, enclosure, etc etc.
